### THEORY:
Different Types of Loops C++ provides three types of loops that works the same, but are preferred in different use cases:

For Loop:
The for loop is an entry-controlled loop, which means that it checks whether the test condition is true before executing the statements inside it. The various parts of the for loop are:

Initialization: Initialize the variable to some initial value.
Test Condition: This specifies the test condition. If the condition evaluates to true, then body of the loop is executed. If evaluated false, loop is terminated.
Update Expression: After the execution loop's body, this expression increments/decrements the loop variable by some value. All these together is used to create a logic and flow of the loop.

2. While Loop:
The while loop is an entry-controlled loop, meaning the condition is checked before the loop body runs. It is particularly useful in scenarios where we don’t know exactly how many times we need to iterate. Unlike the for loop, where the number of iterations is typically known in advance and the loop is constructed based on that, the while loop relies entirely on a condition to determine whether the loop should continue or stop.

Do-While Loop:
The do-while loop is an exit-controlled loop, which means the loop body runs first and then the condition is evaluated. This guarantees that the body of the loop will execute at least once, regardless of whether the condition is true or false at the beginning.

Infinite Loops:
An infinite loop, also known as an endless loop, is a loop that continues to execute indefinitely because the condition never becomes false. This can happen when the loop’s condition always evaluates to true or when there is no exit condition at all.

Nesting of Loops:
Nested loops refer to the concept of placing one loop inside another. In this structure, the inner loop runs entirely for each iteration of the outer loop. This is particularly helpful when dealing with problems that require multiple levels of repetition—such as iterating through a two-dimensional array or generating complex output patterns.

Implementation:

The logic and flow of loops have been explored through various programs such as:

Printing even numbers from 1 to 10

Reversing integer values

Creating a simple password-based login system

Generating different patterns (like star patterns and Floyd's triangle)

Conclusion:

By working through these programs, the functioning and practical use of loops in C++—including their logic, structure, and behavior—have been thoroughly understood.
